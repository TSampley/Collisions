# Collisions
Originally ported from a high school project, the focus of this project is to simulate particle interactions. The current port uses very simple physics and treats particles like billiard balls, but I would like to move to a simulation closer to point-particles representing charge-densities which allows users to optionally define potential energy curves to explore exotic physics.
